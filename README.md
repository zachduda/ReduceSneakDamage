# ReduceSneakDamage

ReduceSneakDamage is a lightweight plugin that reduces a player's fall damage when they are sneaking by a configured
percentage. It also can disable particles and be toggled per world.

# Support
- For **1.16 or newer**, download the latest version.
- For legacy **1.12**-**1.15** support, it is recommended to use **v3.X**, however v4.X should still work fine.
- Servers below 1.12 won't receive support, however additional configuration with RSD v3 *may* work with these versions.

# Spigot
